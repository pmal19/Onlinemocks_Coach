Chat of other person is not showing. When I remove the filter(query) from the display messages, all messages are printed (as expected). So I figure out something is wrong in that part. I spent alot of time to figure out how to fix it but couldn't. I took help from anurag and vipul but they also couldn't figure out what was wrong.

I will go through it again and try to fix it asap.
